During a transitional phase in my career, I took the opportunity to work on several short-term freelancing projects across diverse domains. These projects were commission-based, allowing me to apply my skills as a QA Manual, Automation, and API Tester effectively.

Key Contributions:

Designed and executed comprehensive test cases tailored to the specific requirements of each project.
Worked closely with clients to understand their needs and deliver high-quality testing solutions within tight timelines.
Developed and documented manual and automated test cases to ensure robust test coverage and defect tracking.
Contributed to the end-to-end testing lifecycle, including test case creation, execution, and reporting.
These experiences not only enhanced my domain expertise but also honed my ability to adapt to varied workflows and requirements while maintaining a professional commitment to quality.
